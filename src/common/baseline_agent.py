"""
This script implements a baseline agent. The agent is a greedy agent meaning it will simulate several actions
returned by its _get_tested_action method and execute the one with the highest simulated reward.
Besides the heuristic actions candidates like reconnecting powerlines and doing nothing the agent receives action candidates
from topology policies. These policies may implement a RL-component to predict topological actions. The RL-component evaluates
the actions the topology policy returns the k best actions to the agent to simulate.
